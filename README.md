### Hey there, I'm Zachary Vincze *(Pseudonym FetchDcode)*.

I'm currently a student studying computer science at the University of Toronto and an intern on AMD's Architecture and Software Technologies team.

Check out some stuff I'm working on here. Or, if you're interested give my [website](https://zacharyvincze.com) a look for some more detailed devlogs on what I'm currently working on.

## Interests

-   Systems related programming
-   Emulation development
-   Game development (or rather, game engine development)
-   Breaking things (and putting them back together, mostly)

I like to keep things as low-level as I can.
